# CEPCSW GSF Development

## 1. Introduction and global status

This project develops an electron Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF) refit for CEPCSW.
Its goal is to model tracker-material bremsstrahlung and recover the electron
state at the interaction point more accurately than the standard
`CompleteTracks` result.

The intended physics chain is:

```text
Geant4 pre/post-material-step truth
  -> CEPC step-t/X0-conditioned Bethe-Heitler mixture
  -> multi-component filtering and smoothing
  -> validated interaction-point track parameters
```

`RecGsfTracking` builds, installs, and reads `CompleteTracks`. Smoother and
reverse runs write three row-aligned endpoint views: BestBranch to
`GSFTracksBestBranch`, the moment-matched endpoint to
`GSFTracksWeightedMean`, and the maximum of the complete five-dimensional IP
mixture density to `GSFTracksFullMixtureMode`. FullMixtureMode is
automatic/default-on, has a persisted optimization-status collection and
flat-tuple fields, and is mechanically available but not physics-validated.
Its definition and gates are in
`agents_record/2026-08-24-full-mixture-mode-endpoint.md`; historical CMS-like
extensions remain in dated records only.

Positive-weight final components and complete component lineage are persisted
automatically for smoother and reverse. The `final_mixture_component_*`,
`lineage_node_*`, and `lineage_edge_*` flat vectors retain the final mixture
and every evaluated seed, BH child, measurement result, KL output, cutoff, and
merge. Reverse additionally records same-surface two-filter products
`B_smoothed[i] = F_updated[i] x B_predicted[i]` only at interior surfaces.
Each product is formed inside its reverse-surface step from buffered
`B_predicted[i]` candidates, immediately before the same buffered measurement
results are committed to live `B_updated[i]`.
Direct product candidates persist their pair prior, five-dimensional overlap
chi-square/log-determinant, log weight, normalized pre-pruning posterior,
backward-predicted state, and explicitly named smoothed state.
They also persist signed F/B curvature and pT differences, their approximate
zero-cross-covariance variances, and a passive direction-signed
five-dimensional compatibility score. Its magnitude is the chi-square CDF of
the full F/B state difference and its direction is the signed pT difference.
The score is meaningful on the exact identity pair only; it is not a
calibrated physical posterior and never steers the fit.
They also persist the signed forward/backward differences
`B_predicted-F_updated` in kappa and transverse momentum, with passive
independence-approximation variances; the exact schema contract is in
`agents_record/2026-09-01-forward-backward-delta-diagnostics.md`.
The boundaries reuse live mixtures: `B_smoothed[0] = B_updated[0]` and
`B_smoothed[N-1] = F_updated[N-1]`. Interior product states never propagate or
publish. The compiled/default `InwardWeightMode=LocalMeasurement` also leaves
their weights diagnostic-only. Experimental `SmoothedMarginal` instead sums
the normalized unreduced direct-pair weights over all forward partners for
each backward candidate and attaches that marginal to the corresponding live
`B_updated[i]` state before cutoff, reduction, and further inward propagation.
It deliberately reuses overlapping forward evidence at successive surfaces
and is not a calibrated Bayesian posterior. Its active contract is in
`agents_record/2026-08-31-smoothed-marginal-inward-weighting.md`; the original
passive contracts are in
`agents_record/2026-08-25-final-mixture-component-flat-tuple.md`,
`agents_record/2026-08-25-component-lineage-dag-flat-tuple.md`, and
`agents_record/2026-08-29-smoothed-diagnostic-only-publication.md`; the
explicit boundary correction and focused gate are in
`agents_record/2026-08-29-smoothed-boundary-state-contract.md`, and the inline
construction regression is in
`agents_record/2026-08-29-inline-smoothed-surface-construction.md`; the
surface-local evidence schema is in
`agents_record/2026-08-29-smoothed-surface-local-evidence.md`.

Reverse consumes one `SharedForwardFilterResult` and publishes the terminal
inward mixture `B_updated[0] = measurement[0] x B_predicted[0]`. A positive
`InwardSeedCovarianceScale` copies and scales the final forward population; a
finite value at or below zero builds one fresh standard-KF-style seed, updates
the outermost hit, and first revisits hit `N-2`. The common initializer uses a
direction-local two-dimensional-hit prefit: the three innermost hits outward
and the three outermost hits inward, followed by the loose `FullLDCTracking`
covariance and an explicit boundary-hit MarlinTrk update.
`ForwardSeed=1` and `BackwardSeed=1` independently select the complete
FullLDCTracking-style loose diagonal covariance for the direction-local
prefits. Every finite positive value uniformly scales all five seed variances;
zero and negative values are invalid. `BackwardSeed` is inert when a positive
`InwardSeedCovarianceScale` selects a copied/scaled forward mixture. The
implementation gates and retired curvature-only controls are in
`agents_record/2026-08-28-standard-kf-gsf-initializer.md` and
`agents_record/2026-08-29-fresh-inward-standard-kf-initialization.md`, with
the current scaling contract in
`agents_record/2026-09-06-directional-seed-covariance-scales.md`.

The former CMS-like compatibility alias and `CmsGsfSmoothing` property are
retired because they had become exactly equivalent to reverse while publishing
no distinct endpoint. Historical tuples, source codes 3/4, and dated evidence
remain interpretable; the migration and exact reverse regression gate are in
`agents_record/2026-08-29-cms-like-workflow-retirement.md`. Forward filtering,
an independent reverse multi-component refit, and a KL reduction-aware
experimental smoother remain mechanically operational.
A default-off ECAL component-re-ranking prototype is also mechanically
operational. It preserves `GSFTracksBestBranch` and writes its paired result separately;
its focused evidence is promising only for retained bimodal alternatives and
is not population-validated.
A separate default-off truth BH-loss oracle can replace existing BH-call
responses on explicitly selected tracks while leaving the downstream GSF
workflow unchanged. It is a mechanism diagnostic only and never production
steering.
The normal simulation event can now optionally embed exact
`SimTrackerHit -> Geant4-step` provenance in two PODIO collections. The
default-off oracle's current batch source follows the standard reconstructed-
hit truth associations into those collections, so the maintained workflow no
longer requires or supports a side material tuple or prejoined CSV input.
The active `dump_gsftrk.sh` worker accepts one `STAGES` subset of `sim`, `trk`,
and `gsf` (default `trk,gsf`) and executes selected stages in physical order.
Each stage consumes a predecessor produced in the same job or, when that
predecessor is omitted, the corresponding existing tuple from the input tuple
path. The maintained GSF card writes only the flat tuple; its GSF collections
pass directly in memory to `RecGsfFlatTuple` and are not serialized through
`PodioOutput`. After verifying the flat tuple, the worker removes any tracker
tuple produced by its own `trk` stage; a `gsf`-only job retains its external
tracker input. Calorimeter digitization/reconstruction and `EcalCluster` are
not part of this worker while the ECAL prototype is paused.
A passive interval recorder now persists, in the final
GSF EDM and flat tuple, fractionally integrated Geant4 t/X0/eBrem truth,
DD4hep t/X0 between the same exact truth hooks, and summaries of the actual
forward/reverse component paths. These values never steer the GSF. The
compiled, active reverse-template, and maintained-card default is on.

The active production candidate remains the reverse multi-component refit. It
starts from the complete final forward mixture, scales each full covariance by
`InwardSeedCovarianceScale` (default 100), repeats measurement updates inward,
and publishes the selected branch, moment-matched mixture, and full
joint-density mode in separate row-aligned collections. It has demonstrated
interaction-point momentum recovery in many
hard-bremsstrahlung events and favorable central light/hard performance, but
it also creates clean-track degradation and extreme tails. The KL smoother is
largely LCIO-like and forfeits much of the hard-loss recovery.
The maintained comparison card now deliberately selects
`InwardSeedCovarianceScale=-1` for the fresh-inward-seed campaign. This is
campaign steering only; it does not change the compiled or active-template
default 100. Its reverse branch selects the compiled and active-template
`InwardWeightMode=LocalMeasurement` control; `SmoothedMarginal` remains a
default-off experiment.
Directional BH child creation is independently configurable. The compiled and
inherited active reverse-template defaults are
`ForwardBHSplitting=false, InwardBHSplitting=false`, so an unsteered fit
creates no BH children in either direction. The maintained double-off
diagnostic card now uses the same false/false pair. These gates do not disable
material-path evaluation, passive interval recording, deterministic energy
loss, multiple scattering, propagation, or measurement updates.

The active defaults are `MaterialPathMode=DD4hepBetweenSurfaces`,
`ForwardSeed=1` and `BackwardSeed=1` (the complete FullLDCTracking-style
loose covariance for both direction-local prefits), `MaxComponents=10`,
`ComponentWeightCutoff=1e-4`, `SymmetricKL` reduction ranking,
identity-lineage protection enabled, `ForwardBHSplitting=false`,
`InwardBHSplitting=false`, and `CEPCRuntimeCategoryAligned9Clear`. Despite the
retained selector name, this BH model now has one effective identity plus nine
globally fitted radiative Gaussians. Preserve 12 and 24 components and
`CurrentSurface` as explicit comparison settings. `ActsAtlas` is the only
alternative BH model. Neither model is validated for production physics.

Geant4 pre/post-step data is the authoritative energy-loss truth.
SimTrackerHit momentum is only a detector-level cross-check. Existing Geant4
studies establish a real electron loss tail and bounded fractional-loss
transfer compatibility over the tested 2--10 GeV and theta 85--20 degree
samples. None of the available Bethe-Heitler models is validated for general
CEPC tracker steps.

Population studies show real central recovery, especially for losses at
transitions 5--11, but also new extreme tails. Losses at transitions 0--4 are
predominantly information-limited. Forced-electron-hypothesis muon controls do
not show a universal momentum inflation, but do show clean-core broadening and
outliers. This is a research implementation, not a validated production
algorithm. Broad performance claims and mainline integration require clean
track preservation, reproducible tail control, and independent held-out
validation.

Historical evidence, resolved incidents, exact experiment tables, runbooks,
and superseded decisions live under `agents_record/`. Load historical records
only for regression evidence, design rationale, experiment comparison, or
explicit provenance. Historical detail does not override this live status.

### Project laws and work scope

- Keep implementation changes inside `Reconstruction/RecGsfTracking` unless
  the user explicitly authorizes broader scope for a concrete reason.
- Do not modify KalTest, TrackSystemSvc, MarlinTrk, DDKalTest, or other shared
  CEPCSW packages to compensate for a GSF-specific state-management problem
  unless the user explicitly authorizes a narrow shared interface change.
- Do not hand-code a parallel Kalman measurement update when the baseline
  MarlinTrk interface can provide the required operation.
- Treat Geant4 pre/post-step records as material-energy-loss truth. Do not
  present SimTrackerHit momentum as an exact material transition.
- Do not claim Bethe-Heitler or GSF validation from successful execution,
  finite output, improved chi-square, or selected-sample improvement alone.
  Validation requires interaction-point momentum recovery against generator
  truth in categorized hard-loss events, clean-track safety, and held-out
  population checks.
- Preserve unrelated working-tree changes. Keep source/documentation changes
  separate from generated ROOT files, logs, plots, tables, notebooks, and
  batch cards.
- Use `dev` as the active development branch. Do not switch, create, rename,
  delete, merge, or rebase branches unless the user explicitly requests the
  specific branch operation.
- Use Git frequently during development: inspect status and diffs, and create
  focused checkpoint commits after coherent, proportionately verified core
  implementation or project-knowledge changes. Track, commit, and push all
  C/C++ implementation and header changes across the repository, together
  with documentation, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/` maintenance content, and durable
  `agents_record/` status/history records. This Git rule does not broaden the
  separate implementation-scope law: edits outside
  `Reconstruction/RecGsfTracking` still require explicit authorization. Also
  track the specifically maintained workflow card `DumpGsfTrks/gsf.py.bk`,
  whose complete property steering is part of the documentation contract
  except for the deliberate inherited
  `RecordTruthMaterialIntervals=true` default.
  Keep other run cards/options, analysis scripts, build files, generated ROOT
  files, logs, plots, tables, notebooks, batch cards, and experiment outputs
  uncommitted unless the user explicitly authorizes a specific exception. Do
  not change branches unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` limited to global status, active laws, essential commands,
  and the current focus. Before replacing or removing unique detail, preserve
  it in a dated `agents_record/` entry; replace rather than append focus.
- Whenever a `RecGsfTracking` configurable property is added, removed,
  renamed, or its default/allowed values change, assign a dedicated sub-agent
  to audit the complete option surface. In the same change, synchronize the
  authoritative property reference in
  `Reconstruction/RecGsfTracking/README.md` and the explicit effective
  steering in `DumpGsfTrks/gsf.py.bk`; document intentional historical-card
  differences in `DumpGsfTrks/README.md`.
- Validate every implementation step with comprehensive verbose component
  dumps on a focused event. Once mechanically stable, repeat on hard-loss
  events 11, 16, and 17 before population validation. Build success, finite
  output, or lower chi-square is not a sufficient gate.
- Exclude the stable 133-event secondary-tracker-activity set from
  single-track optimization counts and representative selection, but always
  report it separately as a topology/control population.
- Use same-code direct A/B reruns for final-selection claims; stored outputs
  can drift as the implementation changes.

### Compile and run

Run commands from the repository root. For a complete configured build:

```bash
source setup.sh
./build.sh
```

For the normal focused EL9/LCG 105 development cycle:

```bash
source setup.sh
cmake --build build.105.0.0.x86_64-el9-gcc11-opt \
  --target RecGsfTracking RecGsfFlatTuple -j4
cmake --install build.105.0.0.x86_64-el9-gcc11-opt
```

Run Gaudi options through that environment:

```bash
source setup.sh
build.105.0.0.x86_64-el9-gcc11-opt/run \
  gaudirun.py path/to/options.py
```

Use a small `SelectedEventIndices` list for component diagnostics. Generated
ROOT files and logs are outputs, not status records.

## 2. Current focus

The immediate experiment is numeric inward look-ahead feedback inside the
reverse GSF. The retired `NextMeasurement` and `NextNextMeasurement` string
modes are replaced by `InwardLookaheadDepth`, compiled default zero. With
`InwardWeightMode=LocalMeasurement`, a positive depth `N` probes every
available farther-inward hit `i-1` through `i-N` after an actual BH split on
`i+1 -> i`. Every probe starts independently from the split state, performs no
intervening measurement update or explicit split, and is discarded after its
posterior is evaluated. A failed probe cannot delete a live child.

At local hit 0 no farther-inward probe exists, so only the ordinary terminal
measurement update is performed. A wholly invalid probe hit is omitted from
the average; if every requested probe is invalid, the feedback falls back to
the original prior and normalization recovers the baseline local weighting.

Each probe posterior is normalized separately over components and the valid
probe vectors are averaged. The original BH-prior vector and this averaged
feedback remain distinct until the ordinary adjacent measurement at hit `i`
is evaluated exactly once. Both channels receive the same local likelihood;
their unnormalized contributions are added with no feedback-fraction control,
then globally normalized into the one live state bank before the existing
cutoff, KL reduction, and inward recursion. Probe hits are intentionally reused
later, so this is an uncalibrated evidence-reuse diagnostic rather than a
Bayesian posterior. `SmoothedMarginal` is incompatible with positive depth.

The flat tuple records the separate post-local channels as
`lineage_node_prior_local_posterior` and
`lineage_node_lookahead_local_posterior`; the existing
`lineage_node_normalized_posterior` is the combined live value. Status-3 side
nodes retain the separately normalized posterior for each temporary probe.
Depth zero reproduces the stored LocalMeasurement endpoints exactly on the
focused indices 11, 16, and 17. Depth 1 is mechanically stable but did not
recover event 16 and degraded recovered event 17 from -0.311% to -0.732% in
the first current-control comparison. Depth 2 has verified cumulative
two-probe evaluation and channel normalization, but is not physics-validated.
Exact old/new contracts and gates are in
`agents_record/2026-09-06-delayed-inward-measurement-modes.md`; the deferred
hit-0 single-loss-bank design is preserved in
`agents_record/2026-09-06-hit-zero-single-loss-bank-design.md`.

Next, run an unbiased topology-clear depth scan, at minimum depths 0, 1, and
2. Report no-eBrem, light-eBrem, hard-eBrem, transition-location, clean-core,
and extreme-tail behavior separately. A narrower selected core is not enough:
the experiment advances only if it preserves no-eBrem tracks and does not
increase catastrophic tails. Keep production controls and endpoint definitions
frozen: `DD4hepBetweenSurfaces`, `CEPCRuntimeCategoryAligned9Clear`,
`MaxComponents=10`, `ComponentWeightCutoff=1e-4`, `SymmetricKL`, identity
protection, `ForwardSeed=1`, `BackwardSeed=1`, compiled directional splitting
false/false, and compiled `InwardLookaheadDepth=0`. The maintained comparison
card explicitly selects reverse inward splitting and depth 1 for the current
campaign. ECAL remains paused. Historical detail does not override this live
focus.
